#1. Stop the running Prometheus process that we left running in the previous lecture, and copy the new files to bin folder.
2.  cp -r . /usr/local/bin/prometheus
#3.  Create a file called prometheus.service
4.   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service
#5   Add the script and save
[Unit]
Description=Prometheus Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/prometheus/prometheus --config.file=/usr/local/bin/prometheus/prometheus.yml

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


#Now start and check the service is running.

#sudo systemctl daemon-reload
; sudo service prometheus start
; sudo service prometheus status

We can now leave the new Prometheus service running. If you ever need to stop the new Prometheus service, then type
sudo service prometheus stop
sudo service prometheus status
